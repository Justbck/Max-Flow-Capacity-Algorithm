# Max-Flow-Capacity-Algorithm
Java code for finding Max Flow Capacity in a directed graph with the usage of depth first search.


In optimization theory, maximum flow problems involve finding a feasible flow through a flow network that obtains the maximum possible flow rate.
The maximum flow problem can be seen as a special case of more complex network flow problems, such as the circulation problem.

Given a graph which represents a flow network where every edge has a capacity. 
Also given two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in the graph, find the maximum possible flow from s to t with following constraints: <br>
a) Flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge.<br>
b) Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t.

For example, consider the following graph. <br>
